# Heracles
> This repo holds the under development 2.0.0 version

## 🌐 Introduction
Heracles is an open-source addon for World of Warcraft (wotlk), designed to create and organize multiplayer events directly within the game.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. An addon to rule them all
For the first version, the project was split into two parts : an admin addon for creating events, and a client addon for participating in them.

For this new version, we've decided to merge these two addons for easier installation.

### 2. Plenty of mission types
To give you as much freedom as possible in creating your events, we've added lots of new mission types :
- Kill a mob
- Target an entity
- Go to a location
- Mini-games
    - Memory game
    - Question/answer
    - Hangman game
    - Simon says
    - Death Roll
    - Nim game (don't take the last stick)
    - Jigsaw puzzle
    - TicTacToe
 
### 3. New Web UI
We’ve built a web interface to streamline the generation of event keys (which represent an event’s mission list).

This tool [heracles-webui](https://gitlab.com/devsoleo/heracles-webui), is an essential part of the project. It plays a key role in the generation process and is fully integrated into our development workflow.

## 📦 Installation
1. Download the Heracles repository.
2. Extract the files to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` folder.
3. Launch the game and activate the addon in the addon menu.
