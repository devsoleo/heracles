# Nuttenh-o-tron
> This repo holds the under development 2.0.0 version

## Introduction
Nuttenh-o-tron is an open-source addon for World of Warcraft (wotlk), designed to create and organize multiplayer events directly within the game.

**This community project attracted hundreds of players at its launch that's why we're working on a better v2.**

## Features

### 1. An addon to rule them all üíç
For the first version, the project was split into two parts : an admin addon for creating events, and a client addon for participating in them.

For this new version, we've decided to merge these two addons for easier installation.

### 2. Plenty of mission types üéÆ
To give you as much freedom as possible in creating your events, we've added lots of new mission types :
- Kill a mob
- Possess an item
- Target an entity
- Go to a location
- Mini-games
    - Memo
    - Question/answer
    - Hangman game
    - Simon says
    - Floor is lava
    - Death Roll
    - Stick game (don't take the last stick)
    - Puzzle
    - TicTacToe
 
### 3. New Web UI ‚ú®
We're also working on the creation of a web interface to facilitate the generation of event keys (representing an event's mission list).

Our tool [nuttenh-o-tron-webui](https://github.com/devsoleo/nuttenh-o-tron-webui) is a side-project that is not scheduled for production. We use it for development, so we share it but we cannot guarantee anything.

## Installation
1. Download the Nuttenh-o-tron repository.
2. Extract the files to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` folder.
3. Launch the game and activate the addon in the addon menu.
